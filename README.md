 **In master branch**
 
- 1) The pagination is solved with jQuery in People.js.
- 2) The CSS is all in Index.css. I let the list view for mobile as it was before, because i found it is good as it was.
- 3) In PeopleFilter.js I only add two new Arrays.
- 4) The search suggestions are solved in PeopleHeader.js, where only the names are shown while typing.
 
 
 **In refactored-tasks branch**
 
 - 4) refactored in PeopleHeader.js by using the map() method and creating a ref instead of using id.
